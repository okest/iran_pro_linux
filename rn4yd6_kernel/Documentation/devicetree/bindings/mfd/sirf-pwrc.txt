SiRFSoC Power Controller (PWRC) module

Power Controller is used to control the whole SoC power process.
The power controller controls the process of Power-On sequence,
Power-Off sequence, different power modes switching and power
status configuration. the pwrc is access by io bridge, so the
node's parent should be io bridge.

Required properties:
- compatible: "sirf,prima2-pwrc", or "sirf,atlas7-pwrc"
- reg: Address range of pwrc register set
- sysctl:mfd cell device of pwrc
- rtcm-clk:mfd cell device of pwrc
- onkey:mfd cell device of pwrc

Example:

pwrc@3000 {
	compatible = "sirf,atlas7-pwrc";
	reg = <0x3000 0x100>;
	sysctl {
		compatible = "sirf,sirf-sysctl";
	};

	rtcm-clk {
		compatible = "sirf,atlas7-rtcmclk";
	};

	onkey {
		compatible = "sirf,prima2-onkey";
	};
};

pwrc@3000 {
	compatible = "sirf,prima2-pwrc";
	reg = <0x3000 0x100>;
};
