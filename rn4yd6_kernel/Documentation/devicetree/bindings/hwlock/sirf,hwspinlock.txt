SIRF Hardware spinlock device Binding
-----------------------------------------------

Required properties :
- compatible : shall contain only one of the following:
	"sirf,hwspinlock"

- reg : the register address of hwspinlock

- base-id : the index of the first lock in this device

- num-spinlocks : how many spinlocks this device provides

- #hwlock-cells : hwlock users only use the hwlock id to represent a specific
	hwlock, so the number of cells should be <1> here.

Please look at the generic hwlock binding for usage information for consumers,
"Documentation/devicetree/bindings/hwlock/hwlock.txt"

Example of hwlock provider:
	hwlock {
		compatible = "sirf,hwspinlock";
		reg = <0x13240000 0x00010000>;
		#hwlock-cells = <1>;
		base-id = <0>;
		num-spinlocks = <30>;
	};

Example of hwlock users:
	node {
		...
		hwlocks = <&hwlock 2>;
		...
	};
