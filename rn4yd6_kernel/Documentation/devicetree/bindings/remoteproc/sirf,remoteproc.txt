SIRF Atlas7 Remote processor Device Binding
------------------------------------------------
1) Main node
	Required properties :

	- compatible : "sirf,atlas7-rproc"

	- reg : register address of remoteproc device

	- interrupts: the irq number this rproc need to handle.

	- hwlocks: the hwlocks this rproc to used to protect data
	  between two processors.

	- memory-region: the memory region, which is used to store virtual
	  device info, fifo buffers and share memory between two processors.

	- firmware: the firmware file that will be loaded to remote processor.

Please refer to ../reserved-memory/reserved-memory.txt for details of the
memory-region bindings.
Please refer to ../hwlock/hwlock.txt for details of the hwlock bindings.

2) Example:
			ns_m3_rproc@0 {
				compatible = "sirf,atlas7-rproc";
				reg = <0x13240108 0x4>,
					<0x13240208 0x4>;
				interrupts = <0 123 0>;
				hwlocks = <&hwlock 0>, <&hwlock 1>;
				memory-region = <&ipc_mem0>;
				firmware = "RTOSDemo.bin";
			};
