Required properties:
- cell-index: index of ci_hdrc_platform_data array
- compatible: Should be "sirf,atlas7-usb"
- reg: Should contain registers location and length
- interrupts: Should contain controller interrupt
- sirf,usbphy: phandle of usb phy that connects to the port
- clocks: the clock feeding the controller clock

Recommended properies:
- phy_type: the type of the phy connected to the core. Should be one

Optional properties:
- maximum-speed: limit the maximum speed in Gadget role

Examples:
usb0: usb@17060000 {
	cell-index = <0>;
	compatible = "sirf,atlas7-usb";
	reg = <0x17060000 0x200>;
	interrupts = <0 10 0>;
	clocks = <&clks 120>;
	sirf,usbphy = <&usbphy0>;
	phy_type = "utmi";
	dr_mode = "otg";
	maximum-speed = "high-speed";
};
