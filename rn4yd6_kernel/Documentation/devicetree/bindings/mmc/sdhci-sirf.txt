* SiRFprimII/marco/atlas6 SDHCI Controller

This file documents differences between the core properties in mmc.txt
and the properties used by the sdhci-sirf driver.

Required properties:
- compatible: sirf,prima2-sdhc

Optional properties:
- cd-gpios: card detect gpio, with zero flags.

Example:

	sd0: sdhci@56000000 {
		compatible = "sirf,prima2-sdhc";
		reg = <0xcd000000 0x100000>;
		cd-gpios = <&gpio 6 0>;
	};


* SiRFatlas7 SDHCI Controller

This file documents differences between the core properties in mmc.txt
and the properties used by the sdhci-sirf driver.

Required properties:
- compatible: sirf,atlas7-sdhc
- clocks: A list of phandle + clock-specifier pairs for the clocks listed in clock-names.
- clock-names: Should contain the following:
	"iface" - SDPHY clock (required)
	"core"	- SDHCI clock (required)

Optional properties:
- cd-gpios: card detect gpio, with zero flags.

Example:

	sd1: sdhci@16100000 {
		compatible = "sirf,atlas7-sdhc";
		reg = <0x16100000 0x100000>;
		clocks = <&clks 116>, <&clks 118>;
		clock-names = "core", "iface";
	};
