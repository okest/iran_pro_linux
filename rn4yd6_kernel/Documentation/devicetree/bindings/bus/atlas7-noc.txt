Device tree bindings for CSRatlas7 NoC(Network on Chip)

CSR atlas7 uses a NoC bus, SoC is splitted into mutiple MACROs. Every MACRO
holds some hardware modules. For each MACRO
properties:
- compatible : Should be "arteris, flexnoc"
- #address-cells: should be 1
- #size-cells: should be 1
- ranges : the child address space are mapped 1:1 onto the parent address space

Sub-nodes:
All the devices connected to noc are described using sub-node to noc. For
example, AUDMSCM MACRO includes multimediam nodes such as KAS, AC97, IACC, I2S,
USP0~3, LVDS.
For each MACRO, there is at least a noc service sub-node. This noc service
may provide bandwidth probe, transaction latency profile, error logger, QoS(
quality of service), register firewall(protect registers by region), target
firewall(protect registers by per-register).
Noc service sub-nodes:
properties:
- compatible : Should be one of
	"sirf,noc-macro", "sirf,atlas7-ntfw"
- reg: A resource specifier for the register space
- interrupts : Should be the interrupt number - optional
- regofs: define offset of NoC related registers
	for example:
	regofs = <&cpum 0x800 0x900 0x1050 0>;
	- macro: macro name
	- errlogoff: the offset of errlog register
	- faultenoff: the offset of fault enable register
	- regfwoff: the offset of register firewall register
	- schedoff: the offset of scheduler port register

There are spram firewalls in the system. They can detect illegal
hardware access to a7spram/m3sram for security protection.
if -regofs is not defined, that is the spram firewall.
