- compatible: "sirf,prima2-pulsec"
- reg: Offset and length of the register set for the device
- clocks: The clock is needed by the pulse counter
- interrupts: Should contain the interrupt for the device

Example:
pulsec@10d90000 {
	compatible = "sirf,prima2-pulsec";
	reg = <0x10d90000 0xffff>;
	interrupts = <0 48 0>;
	clocks = <&car 55>;
};
