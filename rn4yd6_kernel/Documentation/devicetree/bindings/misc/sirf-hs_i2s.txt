CSRatlas7 SoC high speed i2s (HS-I2S)

Required properties:
- compatible: "sirf,atlas7-hsi2s"
- reg: register base and size
- interrupts: the interrupt number
- dmas: dma channels
- dma-names: dma transfer direction
- clocks: input clock (see clock-bindings.txt)

Example:

	hsi2s0: i2s0@133d0000 {
		cell-index = <0>;
		compatible = "sirf,atlas7-hsi2s";
		reg = <0x133d0000 0x100>;
		interrupts = <0 114 0>;
		clocks = <&car 71>;
		dmas = <&dmac1 0>;
		dma-names = "rx";
		status = "disabled";
	};
