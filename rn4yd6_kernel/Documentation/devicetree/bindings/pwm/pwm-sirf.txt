SiRF prima2 & atlas6 PWM drivers

Required properties:
- compatible: "sirf,prima2-pwm"
- reg: physical base address and length of the controller's registers
- #pwm-cells: should be 2. See pwm.txt in this directory for a description of
  the cells format.
- clocks: Must contain an entry for each entry in clock-names.
  See ../clock/prima2-clock.txt for details.
- clock-names: Must include the following entries:
  of clock sources to generate PWM signal,
  - pwmc: PWM controller clock
  - sigsrc0: source clock 0 for PWM
  - sigsrc1: source clock 1 for PWM
  - sigsrc2: source clock 2 for PWM
  - sigsrc3: source clock 3 for PWM
  - sigsrc4: source clock 4 for PWM

Example:

pwm: pwm@b0130000 {
	compatible = "sirf,prima2-pwm";
	#pwm-cells = <2>;
	reg = <0xb0130000 0x10000>;
	clocks = <&clks 21>, <&clks 1>, <&clks 2>,
	       <&clks 3>, <&clks 0>, <&clks 4>;
	clock-names = "pwmc", "sigsrc0", "sigsrc1",
		"sigsrc2", "sigsrc3", "sigsrc4";
};
