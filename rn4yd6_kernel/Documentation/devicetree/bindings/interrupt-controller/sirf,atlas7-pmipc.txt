SIRF Atlas7 Power Management Inter-Processor Communication (IPC) Device Binding

atlas7 SoC Power Management requres CPUs coordinate with one anther, thus
IPC is needed for Power Management coordinate.

INT_IPC_TRGT2_INIT0_INTR1 is used for this purpose, it is trigger by A7 to notify M3

Required properties:
- compatible: "sirf,atlas7-pmipc"
- reg: Address range of power management ipc register set

Example:

pmipc@0x13240000 {
	compatible = "sirf,atlas7-pmipc";
	reg = <0x13240000 0x00010000>;
};
