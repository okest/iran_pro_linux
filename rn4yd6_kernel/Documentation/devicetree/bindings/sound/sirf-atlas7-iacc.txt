* SiRF Atlas7 internal audio codec controller

Required properties:
- compatible: "sirf,atlas7-iacc"
- reg: Base address and size entries:
- dmas: List of DMA controller phandle and DMA request line ordered pairs.
- dma-names: Identifier string for each DMA request line in the dmas property.
  These strings correspond 1:1 with the ordered pairs in dmas.

  One of the DMA channels will be responsible for transmission (should be
  named "tx0", "tx1", "tx2" and "tx3" for each channels) and one for
  reception (should be named "rx").

Example:
	atlas7_iacc: atlas7_iacc@10D01000 {
		#sound-dai-cells = <0>;
		compatible = "sirf,atlas7-iacc";
		reg = <0x10D01000 0x100>;
		dmas = <&dmac3 0>, <&dmac3 7>, <&dmac3 8>, <&dmac3 3>, <&dmac3 9>;
		dma-names = "rx", "tx0", "tx1", "tx2", "tx3";
		clocks = <&car 69>;
};
