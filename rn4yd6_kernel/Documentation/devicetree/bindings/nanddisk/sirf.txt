CSR prima2/marco/atlas6 NAND Controller

Required Properties:
- compatible : Should be "sirf,prima2-nand" or "sirf,atlas7-nand"
- reg : Address range of controller
- pinctrl-names : The name of pinctrl
- pinctrl-0 : = The pinctrl needed by NAND controller
- sirf,nand-dma-channel : The DMA channel needed by NAND controller
- interrupts : The NAND interrupt specification
- clocks : The clocks needed by the NAND controller
- sirf,nanddisk-rsvmem-range : The space will be reserved by NAND controller
                               the first contains the space start address,
			       the second contains the space length

Example:

nand@b0030000 {
	compatible = "sirf,prima2-nand";
	reg = <0xb0030000 0x10000>;
	pinctrl-names = "default";
	pinctrl-0 = <&nand_pins_a>;
	sirf,nand-dma-channel = <8>;
	interrupts = <41>;
	clocks = <&clks 26>;
	sirf,nanddisk-rsvmem-range = <0x6000000 0x200000>;
};
