Sirfsoc inner Analog to Digital Converter bindings

The devicetree bindings are for the new ADC driver written for
Prima2/Atlas6 CSR.

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be one of
	* "sirf,prima2-adc": When use Prima2 SOC
	* "sirf,atlas6-adc": When use Atlas6 SOC
- reg: Offset and length of the register set for the device
- interrupts: Should contain the interrupt for the device
- clocks: The clock is needed by the ADC controller
- resets: The reset for the device
- #io-channel-cells: Should be set to <1>

Example:
	adc: adc@b0110000 {
		compatible = "sirf,prima2-adc";
		reg = <0xb0110000 0x10000>;
		interrupts = <34>;
		clocks = <&clks 16>;
		resets = <&rstc 32>;
		#io-channel-cells = <1>;
	};

	adc: adc@b0110000 {
		compatible = "sirf,atlas6-adc";
		reg = <0xb0110000 0x10000>;
		interrupts = <34>;
		clocks = <&clks 16>;
		resets = <&rstc 32>;
		#io-channel-cells = <1>;
	};
